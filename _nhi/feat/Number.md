The `Number` feature for Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl follows the standard UD guidelines for nouns, adjectives,
determiners and adverbs. However, verbs can contain agreement features on person for both the
subject, the object and the direct object, so the Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl treebank follows the UD description for
[layered features](/u/overview/feat-layers.html), defining
[Number[subj]=Sing,Plur](/u/feat/Number-subj.html),
[Number[obj]=Sing,Plur](/u/feat/Number-obj.html) and
[Number[iobj]=Sing,Plur](/u/feat/Number-iobj.html).

Transitive verbs will have subject and object agreement and intransitive verbs will have
only subject agreement. Bitransitive verbs will have either subject and object, subject and
indirect object or subject, object and indirect object agreement.
