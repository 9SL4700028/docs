A Yupik verb may be reflexive and refer to the subject of its main clause as its object.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is reflexive

Note that there is no `No` value. If a verb is not reflexive, the
`Reflex[obj]` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* [ess] _Ighneqa qiyaaq <b>aghyuughyavgu</b>._ "My son cried <b>when you scolded him</b>."
