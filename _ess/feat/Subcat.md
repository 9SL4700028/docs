Yupik verbs are either intransitive or transitive.

### <a name="Intr">`Intr`</a>: intransitive verb

A verb that does not take arguments other than the subject.

#### Examples

* [ess] _Afsengaq <b>neghtuq</b> pagunghaghmeng._ "A mouse ate crowberries." The inflection _-tu-_`Subcat=Intr`


### <a name="Tran">`Tran`</a>: transitive verb

A verb that takes a direct (accusative) object as argument (in addition to the subject).
These verbs can be passivized, then the direct object becomes the subject.

#### Examples

* [en] _to <b>do</b> something, to be <b>done</b> by somebody_
