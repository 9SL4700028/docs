### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

### Examples

* _imeti_ "to have", _vedeti_ "to know", _dobiti_ "to get"
* _morati_ "to must", _moči_ "to be able to", _postati_ "to become"
* _začeti_ "to start,  _iti_ "to go", _priti_ "to come"

If a word is further analyzed into morphemes, verb-yielding derivational morphemes are tagged as `VERB`. These include noun-elaborating suffixes (N→N) that attach to nominal roots and yield nominal bases and nominalizing suffixes (V→N) that attach to verbal roots and yield nominal bases.

### Examples

* _imeti_ "to have", _vedeti_ "to know", _dobiti_ "to get"
* _morati_ "to must", _moči_ "to be able to", _postati_ "to become"
* _začeti_ "to start,  _iti_ "to go", _priti_ "to come"
