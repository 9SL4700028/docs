As other conj subrelation, `conj:appos` is used between conjuncts, that is between elements which are in the same paradigm, i.e which fulfill the same role in relation to their governor. Contrarily to [conj:coord](), conjucts in a `conj:appos` relation have the same referent. Contrarily to [nmod:appos](), an apposed conjunct must respect a specific background prosody.

The elements in a `conj:appos` are not bound to a particular sequence, they can be rearranged in a different order. This choice of relation is meant to emphasize the similarity between some appositions and ordinary coordination.
