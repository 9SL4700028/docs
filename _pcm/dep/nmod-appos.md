The `nmod:appos` relation is used for appositional modifiers, that is nominal elements that serve to define, modify, name, or describe a noun phrase. 

Some appositions present similarities with coordinations, in that they respect a specific background prosody. In that case, the [conj:appos]() relation is used instead of `nmod:appos`.
