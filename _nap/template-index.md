## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

Words are delimited by whitespace or apostrophes. The apostrophes indicate elision, i.e. the omission of a sound in a word.
In Neapolitan, articles undergo elision, e.g.: _unu_-> _'nu_.INDF.M; _de/re_ -> _'e_.GEN

Multiword tokens do occur, namely in the form of ADP+DET.

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.

---

## Morphology

### Tags

Auxiliaries are verbal, usually formed from the verb _av√©_ 'to have'.
(De)verbal forms can be tagged in different ways. Participles are usually tagged as ADJ, sometimes as VERB.

---
**Instruction**: Specify any unused tags. Explain what words are tagged as PART. Describe how the AUX-VERB and DET-PRON distinctions are drawn, and specify whether there are (de)verbal forms tagged as ADJ, ADV or NOUN. Include links to language-specific tag definitions if any.

---

### Features



---
**Instruction**: Describe inherent and inflectional features for major word classes (at least NOUN and VERB). Describe other noteworthy features. Include links to language-specific feature definitions if any.

---

## Syntax



---
**Instruction**: Give criteria for identifying core arguments (subjects and objects), and describe the range of copula constructions in nonverbal clauses. List all subtype relations used. Include links to language-specific relations definitions if any.

---

## Treebanks

There are [N](../treebanks/nap-comparison.html) Neapolitan UD treebanks:

  [Neapolitan-A](../treebanks/nap_a/index.html)
  [Neapolitan-B](../treebanks/nap_b/index.html)

---
**Instruction**: Treebank-specific pages are generated automatically from the README file in the treebank repository and
from the data in the latest release. Link to the respective `*-index.html` page in the `treebanks` folder, using the language code
and the treebank code in the file name.
