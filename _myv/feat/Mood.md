Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite
[verb](myv-pos/VERB) forms.

### `Ind`: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in the
indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will
happen, without adding any attitude of the speaker.

#### Examples

* [myv] _мон <b>содан</b>_ "I <b>know</b>"

### `Imp`: imperative

The speaker uses the imperative to order or ask the addressee to perform the
action of the verb, the subject is limited to the second person.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>паник</b> каштомсо_ "_<b>bake it</b> in the oven_"

### `Cnd`: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express conditions, i.e. protasis, for actions of the main clause.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молиндерятано</b> кинов, а ванови телевидениянь программась_ "<b>if we go</b> to the movies, we won't see the t.v. program"

### `Cnj`: conjunctive

The conjunctive mood (also subjunctive) is used to express actions that would have taken
place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not
happen. It is also used to express volition in both proclamations and questions

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молевлинек</b> кинов_ "we <b>would like to go</b> to the movies"

### `Des` desiderative

The desiderative mood is used to express desired or potential actions that are not fulfilled.

#### Examples

* [myv] _<b>молексэлинек</b> кинов_ "we <b>would have gone</b> to the movies (, but we didn't go)"
* [myv] _<b>прыксэлинек</b>_ "we <b>almost fell over</b> (, but we didn't)"

### `Opt` optative

The optative is used for three persons in two numbers. It expresses a concessive attitude and at time resultative.


#### Examples

* [myv] _ков <b>илязат</b> моле, сайть свал конёв мартот_ "where ever <b>you don't</b> go, always take paper with you (where ever you go,...)"
