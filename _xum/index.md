## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

The Iguvine tablets use a word separator to (: in the Umbrian script and â‹… in the Latin script).
We thus follow native word segmentation as much as possible.
The main exceptions are when the original segmentation itself is erroneous (pesni:mu for pesnimu) and cliticised adpositions that we decided to separate from their host.
