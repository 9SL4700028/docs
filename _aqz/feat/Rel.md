`Rel` is a morpheme that combines with lexical roots and postpositions. They signalize the 
adjacency or contiguity (Rel=Cont) and non-adjacency or non-contiguity of head and depenent, 
e.g., possessor-noun, object-postposition.

### <a name="Cont">`Cont`</a>: contiguous

Contiguity is more often associated with

#### Examples

* _<b>ʃe=r-uβ</b>&nbsp;_ “I have a father / There is my father”
* _<b>ʃe=r-uβ-a</b>&nbsp;_ “My father”

### <a name="NCont">`NCont`</a>: non-contiguous

Non-contiguity is more often associated with

#### Examples

* _<b>t-uβ</b>&nbsp;_ “He has a father / there is his father”
* _<b>t-uβ-a</b>&nbsp;_ “He is (a/the) father / ”


## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
