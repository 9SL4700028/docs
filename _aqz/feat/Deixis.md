`Deixis`  The demonstratives express their deictic reference point, showing their space location in relation to the speech act (distance/person-oriented). The demonstrative appears in a noun phrase coding spatial orientation and position of the element in discussion with respect to the hearer and speaker. They do not have a fixed order; they may appear before or after the noun or appear as the head of a NP.

### <a name="Prox">`Prox`</a>: Proximity

Close to the speaker or the hearer


#### Examples

* _<b>i=no t-et jẽ t-et</b>&nbsp;_ “his other name, this one's name”


## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
