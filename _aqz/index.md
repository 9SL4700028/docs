## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Akuntsú uses all 17 [UPOS](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html), although the class of adjectives is a complicated matter that requires more examination.
* Tokenization and semgmentatoin in Akunstú is straightforward. There are no multiwords that require spaces or dashes.
* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Description of exceptions follows.
* According to typographical rules, many punctuation marks are attached to a neighboring word. We always tokenize them as separate tokens (words).

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.

## Morphology

* Akuntsú is mostly a suffixing language, though its number of affixes and suffixes are relatively small if compared to some other South American languages. Words in this language can be composed as few as single morpheme, or can bear to different affixes. Inflection, derivation and compounding are processes found in the language, and derivation and compounding are productive in word formation. 

NOMINAL FEATURE
* Nominal words, NOUN, PROPN and PRON, are not marked for Gender, plural or animacy.
* There are no classifiers.
* The notion of plural is expressed through numerals, particles or through reduplication.
* The two main values of the Number feature are Sing and Plural. Plural is marked by reduplication.
* Akuntsú has the following nominal [CASES](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/Case.html): Ablative `Abl`, allative `All`, dative `Dat`,  essive `Ess`, locative `Loc`, translative `Tra`, inessive `Ine`.

VERBAL FEATURE
* Verbs tend to combine with categories that denote aspect, modality, and voice.
* The aspectual morphemes include the iterative `Iter`, and habitual `Hab`. There is also a projective aspect.
* Akunstu has the following voice features [VOICE](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/Voice.html): Middle `Mid` and causative `Cau`
