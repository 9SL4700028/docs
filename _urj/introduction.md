# Introduction

The Uralic branch of the Universal Dependencies is a collective documentation
of the Uralic language group. This concerns existing treebanks:

* [Estonian](../../et/),
* [Finnish](../../fi/),
* [Hungarian](../../hu/),
* [Karelian](../../krl/)
* [Komi-Permyak](../../kpv/)
* [Komi-Zyrian](../../kpv/)
* [Livvi](../../krl/)
* [North Sámi](../../sme/)
* [Skolt Sami](../../sms/)

and is hoped to be used as a basis for future Uralic treebanks alongside the
universal guidelines.  This project is a first attempt to co-ordinate unity
within a language group annotation principles and document common best
practices. The project is maintained by [ACL SIG for Uralic
Languages](https://acl-sigur.github.io/).

One of the things that this documentation does is provides comparisons of
existing Uralic treebanks, and either explains the differences or points at
issues in the github.

Another aspect of this documentation is that it provides a go-to reference for
builders of new Uralic treebanks and Universal Dependencies standards, we aim
to answer all the questions for classifying and annotating Uralic sentences.

This reference tells you the differences to the
[Universal](../../u/introduction.html) branch of the documentation, you should
always start reading descriptions from the universal section if something lacks
detail in this Uralic branch.

# Uralic morphological and syntactic analysers

There’s a solid history within uralistic computational linguistics towards
rule-based parsing. It should be noted that many of the traditional parsers
can be relatively easily mapped to Universal Dependencies scheme. See for
example [North Sámi](../../sme/) or [Karelian](../../krl/) for Universal
Dependencies treebanks that have been build in this manner.
