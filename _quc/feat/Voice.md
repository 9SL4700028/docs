In Kʼicheʼ, `Voice` is a feature of some [verbs](quc-pos/VERB). Transitive verbs in Kʼicheʼ agree 
for both subject and object.



### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive

The passive demotes a subject and raises the object to subject status. The agent can be specified
with the relational noun *-umal* which takes possessive agreement. The verb then only has agreement
for a single argument.

#### Examples:

* _Xkikunaj le ali ri ixoqibʼ._
* _<b>Xkunataj</b> le ali (kumal ri ixoqibʼ)._
* _Le ali <b>xkunatajik</b>._

### <a name="Anti">`Anti`</a>: antipassive

The passive demotes an object and leaves the subject in position. The verb then only has agreement
for a single argument.

#### Examples:

* _Xinkunaj alaq._
* _<b>Xinkunan</b> chech alaq._
* _<b>Xkunan</b> alaq chwe._
