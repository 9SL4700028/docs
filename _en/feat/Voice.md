In English, `Voice` is a feature of some [verbs](en-pos/VERB). It is only used to distinguish past participles from passive verbs which both have the PTB tag `VBN`.

### `Pass`: passsive

All verbs with the PTB tag `VBN` that have a [passive auxiliary](en-dep/auxpass) have this feature.

#### Examples:

* _Kennedy was <b>killed</b>._
* _He got <b>shot</b>._
