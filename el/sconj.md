## SCONJ: subordinating conjunction

### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

For coordinating conjunctions, see [CCONJ]().

## Examples

-complementizers, like *αν* / *an* "if", *άρα, αφού* / *ara, afou* "since/therefore", *γιατί* / *yiati* "why/because", *ενώ* / *eno* "while", *καθώς* / *kathos* "as/while", *μήπως, ότι, πως* / *mipos, oti, pos* "that", *ώστε* / *oste* "so as", *ώσπου* / *ospou* "until"
-	adverbial clause introducers, like *όταν* / *otan* "when", *αφότου* / *afotou* "since", or *πριν* / *prin* "before" (when introducing a clause not a nominal)
-	*που* / *pou* "that, where":  it simply introduces a relative clause but it does not inflect, so it is distinguished from relative pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and area analysed as PRON.)
-	interrogative pronouns *ποιος* / *pios* "who", *πόσος* / *posos* "how many/much", *τι* / *ti* "what kind of" that introduce an indirect question that serves as an argument of a verb, e.g., *ρώτησα ποιο/πόσο/τι θέλεις;* / *rotisa pio/poso/ti theleis* "I asked which/how much/what do you want?"
