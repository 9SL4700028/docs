Sometimes, the named element in an appositional construction is expressed in an oblique case (genitive) as if it were a [modifier](u-dep/nmod), while the structure actually remains flat. In this sense, the [`flat`](u-dep/flat) construction "governs" a case. 


#### Examples

* *urbs **Romae***, where *urbs* and *Roma* are coreferent: the city is not a possession of Rome, but Rome itself
