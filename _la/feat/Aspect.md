Latin morphologically distinguishes (at least) three aspects: imperfective, inchoative and perfective. 

The distinction between these three aspects can be made for every [tense](la-feat/Tense) and [mood](la-feat/Mood) of finite [verbal forms](la-feat/VerbForm), except for the imperative mood, where only the imperfective aspect appears. Aspect expresses the way the action, event or state of the verb is considered and presented in its development, and it is distinct both from [temporal reference](la-feat/Tense) and Aktionsart (which pertains to lexicon, and not to morphology).

The different [participial and infinitival forms](la-feat/VerbForm) (participles, gerundives/gerunds and infinitives) are principally distinguished by their aspects, since they do not actually express the grammatical category of [tense](la-feat/Tense) (even if this is implied by some of their traditional denominations). On the contrary, it does not seem justified to assign an aspect to the supine form, as this appears as a fully nominal form, not so different from common (and productive) deverbal [noun](la-pos/NOUN) formations with an [U-stem](la-feat/InflClass).


### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfective aspect

The imperfective aspect uses the simple verbal stem (root + possible thematic vowel; called *infectum* in Latin), to which the suffixes for [mood](la-feat/Mood)/[tense](la-feat/Tense) & [person](la-feat/Person)/[number](la-feat/Number) are attached. It expresses the unfinished, ongoing or continuous nature of an action, an event or a state, and can be regarded as the "basic" aspect in Latin.

The imperfective aspect is not to be confused with the so-called *imperfect* [tense](la-feat/Tense), which is the imperfective aspect of a past tense. 

* Overview of imperfective finite forms for all five conjunctional paradigms and all different moods and tenses (1st pers. sing. act.), present participle, gerundive/gerund and infinitive:

Tense & Mood / Nominal form | 'to love' | 'to see' | 'to read'| 'to seize' | 'to hear'  
--|--|--|--|--|--
Present indicative   | *amo* | *uideo* | *lego* | *capio* | *audio*
Past indicative   | *amabam* | *uidebam* | *legebam* | *capiebam* | *audiebam*
Future indicative   | *amabo* | *uidebo* | *legam* | *capiam* | *audiam*
Present subjunctive   | *amem* | *uideam* | *legam* | *capiam* | *audiam*
Past subjunctive   | *amarem* | *uiderem* | *legerem* | *caperem* | *audirem*
Present imperative (2nd pers. sing.)  | *ama* | *uide* | *lege* | *cape* | *audi*
Future imperative (2nd pers. sing.)  | *amato* | *uideto* | *legĭto* | *capĭto* | *audīto*
Present participle (masc. nom. sing.)  | *amans* | *uidens* | *legens* | *capiens* | *audiens*
*Gerundive** (masc. nom. sing.)  | *amandus* | *uidendus* | *legendus* | *capiendus* | *audiendus*
Infinitive (active)   | *amare* | *uidēre* | *legĕre* | *capĕre* | *audire* 

\* see **Note** about non-traditional aspects

Latin always expresses the imperfective aspect by means of synthetic (i.e. simple) verb forms, except possibly for an attested construction with the present participle and the [copula](la-pos/AUX_), of the type *amans sum*, of [durative](u-feat/Aspect) nuance.

Some verbal stems show irregular variations in their imperfective forms for historical reasons:

* ind. pres., 1st pers. sing. *uolo* 'I want', 2nd pers. sing. *uis*, 3rd pers. sing. *uult*; pres. inf. *uelle*, ...
* ind. pres., 1st pers. sing. *eo* 'I go', 2nd pers. sing. *is*, ...

All Latin verbal stems inflect for imperfective in the active or passive [voice](la-feat/Voice) (and possibly both), with the only notable exceptions of *memini* 'to remember' and *odi* 'to hate' ("perfective" verbs), and *coepi* 'to begin'.

#### Examples

* ***amo*** 'I love/am loving'
* ***uidebatis*** 'you (pl.) were seeing'
* ***capiendum**** 'to be seized' 


### <a name="Inch">`Inch`</a>: inchoative aspect

The inchoative aspect is characterised by the suffix *-sc-*, and corresponding verb forms follow the third [conjugation](la-feat/InflClass) (the one of *legĕre*), i.e. have an athematic stem. It expresses the beginning or the unfolding of an action or event as it is happening. 

* Overview of finite forms for all different moods and tenses (1st pers. sing. act.), present participle and infinitive of the inchoative verb *albesco*:

Tense & Mood / Nominal form | 'to become white'
--|--
Present indicative   | *albesco* 
Past indicative   | *albescebam* 
Future indicative   | *albescam* 
Present subjunctive   | *albescam*
Past subjunctive   | *albescerem*
Present imperative (2nd pers. sing.)  | *albesce*
Future imperative (2nd pers. sing.)  | *albescito* 
Present participle (masc. nom. sing.) | *albescens*
Infinitive   | *albescere* 


Given its nature, the inchoative aspect appears constrained by semantic factors with regard to which verbal roots it can be associated with; most often it is used with (possibly denominal/deadjectival) stems denoting a state in their imperfective forms ("stative" verbs), but it is not limited to them:

* imp. *albeo* 'to be white' , inch. *albesco* 'to become white'
* imp. *horreo* 'to stand on end' , inch. *horresco* 'to rise on end' (later: 'to be/become horrified', implying raising hair)
* imp. *lateo* 'to be hidden' , inch. *latesco* 'to hide oneself'
* imp. *gelo* 'to freeze' , inch. *gelasco* 'to turn to ice'
* imp. *pango* 'to fasten', inch. *paciscor* 'to stipulate a pact'

The inchoative forms are seen to alternate with imperfective and perfective ones:

* imp. *lucet* 'it is clear, it shines' , inch. *lucescit* 'it begins to shine; day is breaking' ; perf. *luxit* 'it has shone; day has broken'
* imp. *paueo* 'I am frightened' , inch. *pauesco* 'I begin to fear' ; perf. *paui* 'I have been struck with fear'

Sometimes, an original inchoative meaning appears to have come to overlap with a more "basic" imperfective one, or it might even have shifted and no longer be so transparent (*pango* ~ *paciscor* is an example), but morphologically there still subsists a distinction. Verbs displaying an inchoative aspect are traditionally lemmatised directly under their inchoative forms (cfr. [VERB](la-pos/VERB)).

For some stems displaying an inchoative form, the respective imperfective form has fallen out of use (and is sometimes not even clearly retraceable anymore) or the ties between the two have gone completely lost with time, so that the once inchoative form has been absorbed into a new paradigm where it acts as the imperfective form, opposed to a perfective one; in such cases, we recognize the new configuration and label the verb with the imperfective aspect:

* imp. *disco* 'to learn', perf. *didici*: originally inchoative (with reduplication and zero-grade) \**di-dc-sco*, tied to the same root as *doceo* 'to teach' (perf. *docui*) 
* imp. *cresco* 'to come into existence; to grow', intransitive, perf. *creui*: tied to the same root as *creo* 'to bring forth', originally 'to make grow', transitive (perf. *creaui*)

#### Examples

* ***albesces*** 'you will become white'
* ***latesce*** 'go hide yourself!'
* ***adulescens*** '(who/which) is growing up' (hence 'young person') 

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfective aspect

Perfective stems (*perfectum* in Latin), to which the suffixes for [mood](la-feat/Mood)/[tense](la-feat/Tense) & [person](la-feat/Person)/[number](la-feat/Number) are attached, show a high degree of variation across different [conjugations](la-feat/InflClass) and even internally to the same conjugation paradigm (especially for the third conjugation). Historically, the Latin perfective represents the convergence of different aspects (aorist and perfect) and patterns starting from Proto-Indo-European, which later became all integrated into paradigms showing a basic imperfective/perfective contrast. The perfective aspect expresses an action as a whole, in its completed state, as a result. 

The perfective aspect is not to be confused with the so-called *perfect* [tense](la-feat/Tense), which is the perfective aspect of a(n originally) present tense, often described as having shifted to a simple past reference. Latin has no perfective imperative. Perfect finite and non-finite verb forms might show slight variations, again as a result of historical processes, but they are all functioning and labeled as perfective.

* Overview of perfective finite forms for all five conjunctional paradigms and all different moods and tenses (1st pers. sing. act.), perfect and future participle, and infinitive:

Tense & Mood / Nominal form | 'to love' | 'to remind' | 'to read'| 'to seize' | 'to hear'  
--|--|--|--|--|--
Present indicative (~past reference?)   | *amaui* | *monui* | *lēgi* | *cepi* | *audiui*
Past indicative   | *amaueram* | *monueram* | *lēgeram* | *ceperam* | *audiueram*
Future indicative   | *amauero* | *monuero* | *lēgero* | *cepero* | *audiuero*
Present subjunctive (~past reference?)   | *amauerim* | *monuerim* | *lēgerim* | *ceperim* | *audiuerim*
Past subjunctive   | *amauissem* | *monuissem* | *lēgissem* | *cepissem* | *audiuissem*
Perfect participle (masc. nom. sing.) | *amatus* | *monitus* | *lectus* | *captus* | *auditus*
*Future participle** (masc. nom. sing.) | *amaturus* | *moniturus* | *lecturus* | *capturus* | *auditurus*
Infinitive  | *amauisse* | *monuisse* | *lēgisse* | *cepisse* | *audiuisse* 

\* see **Note** about non-traditional aspects

There are no synthetic forms for perfective [passive](la-feat/Voice) forms, so that, to express them, Latin resorts to a periphrastic construction putting together the perfect participle and the [copula](la-pos/AUX) in the given tense/mood and person/number, e.g. *amatus sum/eram/ero/sim/essem/es/esse* 'I have been/was/will be/... loved' etc.

Some verbs express the perfective aspect by means of suppletive forms:

* imp. *fero* 'I bring', perf. *tuli* 'I have brought', perf. part. *latus* 'brought'
* imp. *fio* 'I become', perf. *factus sum* 'I have become', actually expressed as 'I have been made' (this perfect is more a periphrasis than a grammaticalised paradigm)

Some verbal stems only appear in their perfective forms:  *memini* 'to remember' and *odi* 'to hate' ("perfective" verbs), and *coepi* 'to begin'.

#### Examples

* ***amaui*** 'I have loved'
* ***monueratis*** 'you (pl.) had reminded'
* ***captum*** 'seized' 

### <a name="Prosp">`Prosp`</a>: prospective aspect

If the prospective aspect is used in the annotation (see **Note**), it appears only in two [non-finite](la-feat/VerbForm) forms, i.e. the gerundive/gerund (morphologically just one form, with possibly different behaviours on the syntactic level) and the so-called "future" participle.


#### Examples

* ***amaui*** 'I have loved'
* ***monueratis*** 'you (pl.) had reminded'
* ***captum*** 'seized' 

##### Note: non-traditional aspects for Latin

It might be argued that the nominal forms of gerundive/gerund and future participle do not actually express the imperfective and perfective aspect respectively, but are instead instances of some other aspects tied to the notion of relative, immediate future and/or necessity, like e.g. the prospective aspect. For the moment, however, they keep the imperfective/perfective labels in the annotation.
