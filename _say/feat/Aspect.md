In Zaar, the aspect features are expressed together with tense and mood features in a word functioning as a preverbal clitic tagged as an AUX. the exceptions are the inchoative and the resultative aspects which are directly attached to the verb, as a suffix for the inchoative, and a verbal particle (syntactic link = compound:prt) for the inchoative. 

### <a name="Aor">`Aor`</a>: aorist

Zaar: The aorist is the default aspect, morphologically unmarked, and tonally associated with a low tone. It is used where TAM values are backgrounded, and in narration where they are contextually recoverable. 

#### Examples

- _kóː <b>kə</b> yé wuriː ?//_ "Or how do you see it?"

- _myáː mandá <b>mə</b> tawséy =tə mə́n sòːséy //_ "I began to pity him really."

### <a name="Conc">`Conc`</a>: concomitant

Zaar: In narrations, the concomitant marks an unbounded process functioning as a temporal frame for another process. The inflection follows the pattern "pronoun+_yáː_+_náː_"

#### Example

- _<b>myáːnaː</b> tul gìp Kìmsə́ < káwây màːʃîn < fi mə́kə́p //_ "we had just entered Kimse when the motorcycle stopped."

### <a name="Inch">`Inch`</a>: inchoative

Zaar: The inchoative marks the beginning of a process. It can also change the lexical meaning of a verb from a state verb to a process verb (e.g. from 'sit' to 'sit down'). It is expressed by the post-verbal particle _ni_.

#### Example

- _ín yǎː gàmá ʃaɣndí < tə̀ tsə̌tn <b>ni</b> //= tə̀ ʧòpʃí //= tə̀ lyàː lyáːwàːsə̀n //_ "If they have finished cooking, they sit down, they wash and they rest."

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect

Zaar: The imperfect marks an unbounded process or state, seen from the point of view of its unfolding and not as a bounded or completed event. It can be used in any temporal context, past, present or future.

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="ImpIter">`ImpIter`</a>: TODO

TODO

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Iter">`Iter`</a>: iterative

TODO

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect

Beja: The perfect has a resultative value. The process or state is considered as having an impact on the moment of enunciation or another moment given by the context.

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive

TODO

#### Example

TODO

### <a name="Res">`Res`</a>: resultative

TODO
