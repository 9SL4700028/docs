`Definitizer=Yes` is currently used in the GJA treebank to signal the definitizer suffix. 


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: the word contains a definitizer suffix.

The definitizer suffix is attached to nouns precedeed by a word that is usually a demonostrative pronoun.

#### Examples

* _Kadtung bata<b>a</b> kay badlongon._ “That child is naughty.” (The definitizer suffix is attached to _bata "child", with the demonstrative pronoun _kadtu "that" 
and in this example _kadtu has an attached linker suffix _nga.)
