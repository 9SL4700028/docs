A clausal complement is a clause which modifies complements a verbal predicate. This dependent is a clausal argument of the predicate (or else it is an [obl:obj](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_gub/dep/obl-obj.md)), and the dependent is the main predicate of the subordinate clause.

Generally, Guajajara's clausal complements occur in reported speech and are core arguments of the reporting verb.
