## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Tokens are delimited by a) whitespace, b) apostrophe and c) hyphen as follows:
  * Whitespace is the default token delimiter
  * Apostrophe is a delimiter for proclitic variants of prepositions/case markers *b'*, *f'*, *m'*, *s'* and *t'*
  * Hyphens is a delimiter for the definite article *il-* and its assimilated forms which include prepositions/case markers with fused definite definite article; these are - for the moment - treated as single tokens.
* Words with spaces or multi-word tokens do not occur in MUDT.

 * XPOS PART_ACT *qiegÄ§ed* and its forms as the copula
