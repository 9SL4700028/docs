# UD for Korean <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/KR.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* The tokenization of the Korean UD treebanks follows the tokenization of the Korean data distributed
  by the [SPMRL 2013 shared task](http://www.spmrl.org/category/spmrl2013.html), which is
  a straightforward whitespace-based tokenization with conventional separation of punctuation.
  Each token can contain one or more morphemes separated by plus (`+`) signs.

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.
