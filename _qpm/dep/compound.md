compound is applied to relations concerning multiword expressions or any kind of X0 compounding: noun compounds (e.g., phone book), but also verb and adjective compounds. 
Note that the compound is not used to link an inherently reflexive verb with the reflexive morpheme (which in Pomak is marked as expl:pv):

~~~ sdparse
jirmí bin  
twenty thousands
compound (jirmí, bin)
~~~
