A nominal subject `nsubj` is a nominal which is the syntactic subject and the proto-agent of a clause. In more simple words, it is the element that carries out an action, the “doer” of the clause. Therefore, it is the main core argument of the verb. This nominal may be headed by either a noun, a pronoun or a relative pronoun, or even an adjective, in ellipsis context:
