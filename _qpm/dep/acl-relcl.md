The acl:relcl label denotes a sub-relation of the acl label. It refers to a relative clause modifier of a nominal, which is a clause that modifies a nominal. It is also a co-referential with a constituent within the relative clause. A relative clause is characterized by finiteness and usually the modified noun in the embedded clause is omitted. The acl:relcl relation directs from the head of the modified nominal to the head of the relative clause.
In Pomak relative clauses appear mostly to be finite, since they are introduced either by a relative determiner (e.g. žýjen-žána-žóno), or by a relative pronoun (e.g. déno-déna-déno):
