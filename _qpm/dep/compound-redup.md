The label `compound:redup` (reduplicated compounds) is a sub-type of compound relation that covers a range of reduplicated forms.
Reduplication is a common process, especially with adverbs and adjectives. The reduplication typically involves two identical words, but some morpho-phonological alternations  are possible.
Usually, the head is the last word. This dependency is traced in Pomak, too:  

~~~ sdparse
adín sítan sítan dožd letǽšo  
a very soft rain was raining 
lit: a soft soft rain was raining
compound:redup (sítan, sítan)
~~~

It also appears in loans from Turkish:

~~~ sdparse
déteno javáš javáš narášte
the child slowly slowly grows up
compound:redup (javáš, javáš)
~~~
