The sub-type relation named oblique argument `obl:arg` is used to distinguish them from adjuncts, which use the plain obl relation. In Pomak annotating, an oblique argument seems to bare the semantic notion of an object, which is expressed by prepositional phrases in accusative case:

~~~ sdparse
gǘvendisom so na mókse bráta 
I rely on my brother 
lit: rely-I  myself  on by-me brother-the
obl:arg (gǘvendisom, bráta)  
~~~
