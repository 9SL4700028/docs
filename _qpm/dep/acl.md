The `acl` label (adnominal clause or clausal modifier of noun) is applied to finite and non-finite clauses that modify a nominal,
which also stands as the head of this relation, while the dependent is the head of the clause that modifies the noun.  
In Pomak this relation appears in accordance to the above mentioned, as seen in the following example:

~~~ sdparse
