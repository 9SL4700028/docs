`aux:q`  (question auxiliary): This sub-type is used for any optative auxiliary particle. 
Even though this relation has been set in former UD versions, it was necessary to use it in annotating Pomak language, since there exists a unique question particle (namely “li ?”), 
which needs to be marked under a label of its own:

~~~ sdparse
dojdéš   li ? 
are you coming? 
lit: you-come ?
root (dojdéš)
aux:q (dojdéš, li)
punct (dojdéš, ? question mark)
~~~
