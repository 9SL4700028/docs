An adjectival modifier (amod) of a noun (or pronoun) is any adjectival phrase that serves to modify the noun (or pronoun). 
An adjectival modifier dependent may have its own modifiers, but the dependent should not be a clause.
In Pomak such relations appear as seen in the following example:

~~~ sdparse
harésavot mi stáry kámatny kaménøvy rabaty 
I like old nice stone things  
lit: pleases to-me old nice stone things  
amod (rabaty, stáry)
amod (rabaty, kámatny)
amod (rabaty, kaménøvy)
~~~ 

In Pomak annotating this label has been applied to particples acting as adjectives:

~~~ sdparse
našól je pad annók gábra annó zmíje paledéno ad mrazáne
under a tree he found a snake frozen from the cold
lit: found-he under a tree a snake frozen from cold-the
amod (zmíje, paladéno)
~~~
