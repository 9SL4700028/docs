Parataxis (parataxis) is a relation between a word (often the main predicate of a sentence) and other elements, such as sentential parenthetical or a clause after a set of quotation marks enclosing either a colon (“ : ”) or a semi-colon (“ ; ”) that are placed side by side without any explicit coordination, subordination, or argument relation with the head word. Normally the first part of the sentence is considered as the head and the second as the parataxis:

kanána še si stori bádin samýj néma da mu go níkutri druk stóri   
whatever someone does on their own cannot be done by someone else 
lit: whatever will himself do someone alone it is not possible him-to this no-one other  do
parataxis (stóri, stóri)

Parataxis is also applied to side-by-side sentences, i.e, a pair of potentially stand-alone sentences, which are rather being treated together as a single clause. This may take place because the sentence segmentation was done primarily according to the sentence-final punctuation; these sentences may be joined by punctuation such as a colon or a comma,  while they may not be delimited by punctuation at all. Also, there may be more than two sentences joined in this manner, where the last ones are depended on the first one. Moreover, when a speech verb interrupts a reported speech content, the interruption is treated as a parenthetical parataxis:

“kúčeto”, káza afčáret, “na háfna níta annóš” 
“the dog”  says the shepard,  “did not bark even once”  
lit: “dog-the”, said shepard-the, “not bark neither once”
parataxis (kúčeto, afčáret)

In Pomak annotating, the parataxis label has also been used to mark the narrating person or the speaking persons of a dialogue marked by a colon (:), whether their speech follows either enclosed in quotation marks (“ ”) or not. In this case the person is linked in a parataxis relation to the root of the sentence:

Jurké : Ne préče mí játse da sme nannó ! 
Yurke: It does not matter to be together!
parataxis (préče, Jurké)
