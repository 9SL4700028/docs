## Degree

Degree of comparison is typically an inflectional feature of some [adjectives](../../u/pos/ADJ) and [adverbs](../../u/pos/ADV).

In Pomak τηε comparative and superlative degree of adjectives and adverbs is formed by using the particles pó_ "more" και _naj_ "most", which are posed before an adjective or adverb as a separate word and are annoted by the `Degree=Cmp` and `Degree=Sup` correspondingly.

### <a name="Pos">`Pos`</a>: positive, first degree

Pomak adjectives are not tagged for positive degree. 

#### Examples

- _<b>mlad</b> _čulǽk_ "[a] young man" 
- _<b>slátko</b> _játo_ "[a] tasty food" 
- _<b>visóka</b> _barčína_ "[a] high mountain" 

- _<b>bóržo</b> _so_ _vórnahte_ "come back soon" 

### <a name="Cmp">`Cmp`</a>: comparative, second degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of another object.

#### Examples

- *újko je <b>pó mlad</b> ad báte ti* "my uncle is younger / more young than your big brother" 
- *májčinono játo je <b>pó slátko</b> ad lélinono* "[the] food of the mother is tastier / more tasty than [the one] of the aunt" 
- *hórehon je <b>pó visók</b> at čeréšono* "the walnut-tree is higher /more high than the cherry-tree"

- *dečjáta so vórnaho <b>pó bóržo</b> at tóga* "the children returned earlier / more early than him" 

### <a name="Sup">`Sup`</a>: superlative, third degree

The quality of one object is compared to the same quality of all other objects within a set.
