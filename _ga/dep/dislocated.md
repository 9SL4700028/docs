The `dislocated` label is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence, and may be separated off with a comma intonation. Few examples of this have been observed in the Irish treebank thus far.
