Deixis is typically a feature of demonstrative [pronouns](u-pos/PRON), [determiners](u-pos/DET), and [adverbs](u-pos/ADV).
Its value classifies the location of the referred entity with respect to the location
of the speaker or of the hearer. The common distinction is distance (proximate vs.
remote entities); in some languages, elevation is distinguished as well (e.g., the
entity is located higher or lower than the speaker).

### <a name="Prox">`Prox`</a>: proximate

The entity is close to the reference point (e.g., to the speaker).

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>this</b> dog_
* [en] _<b>here</b>_
* [es] _<b>aquí</b>_ “<b>here</b>”

### <a name="Med">`Med`</a>: medial

The entity is neither close nor far away from the reference point (e.g., from the speaker).

#### Examples

* [es] _<b>ahí</b>_ “there”

### <a name="Remt">`Remt`</a>: remote, distal

The entity is far away from the reference point (e.g., from the speaker).

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>that</b> dog_
* [en] _<b>there</b>_
* [es] _<b>allí</b>_ “<b>there</b>”
