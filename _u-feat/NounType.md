We already split common and proper nouns at the level of POS
tags but some tagsets mark other distinctions.

### <a name="Class">`Class`</a>: classifier

Chinese classifiers between cardinal numbers and nouns.

Note that this
is the only value of NounType. Interset also has the values “com” and
“prop” but in Universal Dependencies these two are distinguished
already at the level of POS tags.

#### Examples

* [zh] 三<b>項</b>工程 / _sān <b>xiàng</b> gōngchéng_ “three projects”
