`Gender` is usually a lexical feature of [nouns](u-pos/NOUN) and inflectional feature
of other parts of speech ([pronouns](u-pos/PRON),
[adjectives](u-pos/ADJ), [determiners](u-pos/DET), [numerals](u-pos/NUM),
[verbs](u-pos/VERB)) that mark agreement with
nouns. In English gender affects only the choice of the personal
pronoun _(he / she / it)_ and the feature is usually not encoded in
English tagsets.

See also the related feature of [Animacy]().

African languages have an analogous feature of [noun classes](NounClass): there
might be separate grammatical categories for flat objects, long thin
objects etc.

### <a name="Masc">`Masc`</a>: masculine gender

Nouns denoting male persons are masculine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically masculine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* [cs] _<b>hrad</b>_ "castle"

### <a name="Fem">`Fem`</a>: feminine gender

Nouns denoting female persons are feminine. Other nouns may be also
grammatically feminine, without any relation to sex.

#### Examples

* [de] _<b>Burg</b>_ "castle"

### <a name="Neut">`Neut`</a>: neuter gender

Some languages have only the masculine/feminine distinction while
others also have this third gender for nouns that are neither
masculine nor feminine (grammatically).

#### Examples

* [en] _<b>castle</b>_
* [cs] _<b>dítě</b>_ "child"
* [sv] _<b>barn</b>_ "child"
