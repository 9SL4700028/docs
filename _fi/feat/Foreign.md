Is this a foreign word? Not a loan word and not a foreign name but a
genuinely foreign word appearing inside native text. This feature
would apply either to the "X" part of speech (unanalyzable token), or
to other parts of speech if we know and are willing to annotate the
class to which the word belongs in its original language.

Note: the UD `Tscript` (transcribed) value is not used in UD Finnish.

### <a name="Foreign">`Foreign`</a>: it is foreign
