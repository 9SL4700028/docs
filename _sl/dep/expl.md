The `expl` relation captures expletive or pleonastic nominals. These are nominals that appear in an argument position of a predicate, but which do not themselves satisfy any of the semantic roles of the predicate.

In Slovene treebanks, this relation is mostly used for the clitic forms of the reflexive pronoun _**se**_ (_se_, _si_; 'oneself') attached to inherently reflexive verbs, i.e. verbs that that cannot occur without _se_ (e.g. _oddahniti si/se_ 'to be relieved') or change the meaning when they do (e.g. _dati se_ 'can, be able to' vs. _dati_ 'to give'). This also holds for the reflexive _se_ occurring as a voice marker in passive constructions (e.g. _se re훾e_ 'is said'). 

If, on the other hand, the reflexive functions as a nominal with a clearly identifiable semantic role, it is analyzed as direct ([obj]()) or indirect ([iobj]()) object.

In addition to the reflexive pronoun, the `expl` relation is also used with accusative clitic forms of the personal pronouns _ga_ 'him' and _jo_ 'her' in verbal idiomatic expressions like in the examples below, where the pronoun lies outside the predicate-argument structure.
