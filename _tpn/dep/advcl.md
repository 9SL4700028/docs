An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies
a verb or other predicate),
as a modifier not as a core complement. 
This includes things such as a temporal clause,
consequence, conditional clause, purpose clause, etc.
The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]())
and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.

Tupinambá adverbial dependent clauses require the verb to be in the gerund

~~~ sdparse
Tasóne emonã tekó potá .  I shall go wanting things this way
advcl(tasóne, potá)
~~~

When the dependent verb is intransitive coreferential argument indexes are used (switch-reference)

~~~ sdparse
Ajur witu . I ago in order to stay
advcl(ajur, witu)
~~~
