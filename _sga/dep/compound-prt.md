The subtype `compound:prt` is used in Old Irish UD treebanks to express the relation between preverbs and the remaining portion of a compound verb, where the preverb is considered an integral part of the verb expression. The governor of the dependency is the verb, and the dependent is the preverb.

### Example

* _<b>as</b>beir_  "he speaks/says"
* _<b>ad</b>c√≠_  "he sees"
* _<b>do</b>beir_  "he gives"
* _<b>fo</b>gaib_  "he finds"
