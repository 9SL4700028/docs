# Tokenization

* Frequently occurring affixes such as **demonstrative and emphatic suffixes** are always separated from preceding tokens and considered to be tokens themselves:
** _cuci sium_
* Where forms of a significant part of speech such as the **article**, the **copula**, or **possessive pronouns** occur in reduced or altered form when combined with other tokens, these forms are considered to be conjoined tokens:
** _cosin, isnaib, frisna_
** _manam_
