In Old Irish generally adjectives follow the noun they qualify; _catt <b>bán</b>_ "<b>white</b> cat", _grían <b>gel</b>_ "bright sun". A select few adjectives precede the noun, however, forming a compound with it. These include _<b>dag-</b>_ "<b>good</b>", _<b>droch-</b>_ "<b>bad</b>", _<b>il-</b>_ "<b>many</b>" and _<b>sen-</b>_ "<b>old</b>". Unlike the regular adjectives, prefixed forms do not inflect to conform with the case, number and gender of the affected noun.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is a prefix

The prefix feature is only applied to prefixed adjectives, and is always given the affirmative value, "Yes". Adjectives which are not labelled with the prefix feature should be assumed to be regular adjectives.

#### Examples

* _<b>Sen</b>goidelc_ “<b>Old</b> Irish”
* _<b>il</b>bélre_ “<b>many</b> languages”
* _<b>óin</b>fer_ “<b>single</b> man”
