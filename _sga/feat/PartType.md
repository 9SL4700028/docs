Several types of particle exist in Old Irish, many of which may take the same form but serve distinct functions. These include the augment, _ro_ (whether it occurs within a verb token or in isolation), the deictic particle, _í_, the numeric particle, _a_, as well as various preverbs and conjunct particles including _ad_, _as_, _do_, and _no_.

### <a name="Aug">`Aug`</a>: augment

The augment is a particle which is used within the verbal complex. It serves a variety of grammatical purposes, for example, giving perfective force to a verb. It’s most frequent form is _<b>ro</b>_.

#### Examples

* _<b>ro</b>scríb_ “that has written”
* _<b>ro</b>cinnius_ “I have defined”
* _<b>ro</b>bae_ “has been”

### <a name="Dct">`Dct`</a>: deictic

The deictic particle, _í_, refers back to a previously mentioned person or thing.

#### Examples

* _a <b>ní</b> sin_ “that (aforementioned thing)”
* _isnaib <b>hí</b>_ “in those (aforementioned thing)”
* _dond <b>í</b>_ “to that (thing)”

### <a name="Num">`Num`</a>: numeric

These precede cardinal numbers when counting.

#### Examples

* _<b>a</b> tri_ “three”
* _<b>a</b> noi_ “nine”

### <a name="Vb">`Vb`</a>: verbal

A variety of preverbs are treated as verbal particles, including the "empty" preverb, _no_, used to infix pronouns where no preverb or conjunct particle would otherwise be present.

#### Examples

* _<b>do</b>gní_ “it makes/does”
* _<b>at</b>tá di ṡeirc_ “it is for love”
* _ce<b>nu</b>d sluindi_ “although it signifies”
