### Definition

In Tatar `AUX` is used for the modal auxiliary (or past-tense copula) _иде-_.
A number of verbs (_бул-_, _бар-_, _тор-_, _җибәр-_, etc.) can function as an auxiliary verb,
but they are tagged as `VERB`, and their dependency label indicates their use (auxiliary, copula or content verb).

### Examples

* _Өйдә идем_ "I was at home."
* _Укырга теләр идек_ "We would like to study."
