This feature indicates, for the head of a [fixed
expression](https://universaldependencies.org/en/dep/fixed.html), the
effective UPOS of the full expression when it differs from the UPOS of
the word itself.

`ExtPos` is used in the [SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/)
framework and appears in the MISC column of some UD treebanks. Its
inclusion in FEATS is currently specific to some treebanks, and only
heads of the `fixed` relation, though in the future it may be
broadened.
