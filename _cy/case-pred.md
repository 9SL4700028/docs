In Welsh, nominal predicates need a special particle _yn_. The same particle is used for adjectives in adverbial position

### Examples

* _Mae Mair **yn athro**_ "Mair is **a teacher**"
* _Mae Ioan **yn gryf**_ "Ioan is **strong**"

* _Mae Ioan yn cerdded **yn gyflym**_ "Ioan is running **fast**"

N.B.: the predicative particle _yn_ triggers soft mutation on the following noun and adjective. It must not be confused with the imperfect TAM _yn_ (before verbnouns) which does not trigger any mutation and the prepostion _yn_ "in" which triggers nasal mutation
