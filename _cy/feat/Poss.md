In Welsh, `Poss` is a Boolean feature of [pronouns](en-pos/PRON). It tells whether the word is possessive.
The possessive pronoun can be reduplicated after the possessed noun, using a different form

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possesive

#### Examples

* _eich tŷ_ "your (plur) house"
* _eich tŷ chi_ "your (plur) house"

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the `Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column.
