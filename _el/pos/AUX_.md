### Definition
An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. 

The verb *έχω* / *echo* "have" and the particle *θα* are assigned the tag [AUX]() in periphrastic verb tenses, both active and passive ones. 

In all constructions that include *είμαι* /ime “to be”  and a participle, the tag <code>VERB</code> and the syntactic tag <code>aux</code> are assigned to *είμαι*  “to be”. The participle is assigned the tag <code>VERB</code> and bears values for the feature <code>Voice</code>.

Auxiliary verbs like "μπορει"  should be assigned with the Mood value: Pot Pot: Potential 
The action of the verb is possible but not certain. This mood corresponds to the modal verbs can, might, be able to, too.
