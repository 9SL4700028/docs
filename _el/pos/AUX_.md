### Definition
An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. 

The verb *έχω* / *echo* "have" and the particle *θα* are assigned the tag [AUX]() in periphrastic verb tenses, both active and passive ones. 

When a participle depends on the verb *είμαι* /ime “to be”, the tag <code>VERB</code> and the syntactic tag <code>aux</code> are assigned to *είμαι*  “to be”. The participle is assigned the tag <code>VERB</code> and bears values for the feature <code>Voice</code>.

With auxiliary verbs like *μπορεί* / *bori* "may be", the value of the feature <code>Mood</code> is <code>Pot</code>.


### Examples
-	Tense auxiliaries: *έχει φύγει* / *echi figi* "he/she/it is gone", *θα φύγει* / *tha figi* "he/she/it will go"
-	Auxiliaries with passive verb forms: *έχει γραφτεί* / *echi grafti* "he/she/it has been written", *θα γραφτεί* / *tha grafti* "he/she/it  will be written"
