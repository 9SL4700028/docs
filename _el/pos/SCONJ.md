## SCONJ: subordinating conjunction

### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

*που* is assigned the tag <code>PRON</code> if it refers to a noun, e.g. *Έχουμε πολλές πληροφορίες, που*.PRON *δεν οδηγούν όμως πουθενά* "we have much information that, however, leads to nowhere". However, it is assigned the tag <code>SCONJ</code> when it introduces a  complement of saying or sense verbs  (criterion: in this case, it can be replaced with the word *ότι* with somewhat different implications), e.g., *Σε είδα που τον κοίταζες.* "I saw that you watched him.",  *Δεν άκουσες που είπε: «Ευχαριστώ, ωραία μου κυρία»;* "Haven't you heard him saying "Thanks my fair lady"?"

For coordinating conjunctions, see [CCONJ]().

## Examples

- complementizers, like *αν* / *an* "if", *άρα, αφού* / *ara, afou* "since/therefore", *γιατί* / *giati* "why/because", *ενώ* / *eno* "while", *καθώς* / *kathos* "as/while", *μήπως, ότι, πως* / *mipos, oti, pos* "that", *ώστε* / *oste* "so as", *ώσπου* / *ospou* "until"
-	adverbial clause introducers, like *όταν* / *otan* "when", *αφότου* / *afotou* "since", *πριν* / *prin* "before", *μόλις* / *molis* "just, as soon as" (when introducing a clause, not a nominal)
-	interrogative pronouns *ποιος* / *pios* "who", *πόσος* / *posos* "how many/much", *τι* / *ti* "what kind of" that introduce an indirect question that serves as an argument of a verb, e.g., *ρώτησα ποιο/πόσο/τι θέλεις;* / *rotisa pio/poso/ti theleis* "I asked which/how much/what do you want?"
