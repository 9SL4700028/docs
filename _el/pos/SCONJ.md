## SCONJ: subordinating conjunction

### Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

For coordinating conjunctions, see [CCONJ]().

## Examples

- complementizers, like *αν* / *an* "if", *άρα, αφού* / *ara, afou* "since/therefore", *γιατί* / *giati* "why/because", *ενώ* / *eno* "while", *καθώς* / *kathos* "as/while", *μήπως, ότι, πως* / *mipos, oti, pos* "that", *ώστε* / *oste* "so as", *ώσπου* / *ospou* "until"
-	adverbial clause introducers, like *όταν* / *otan* "when", *αφότου* / *afotou* "since", *πριν* / *prin* "before", *μόλις* / *molis* "just, as soon as" (when introducing a clause, not a nominal)
-	*που* / *pou* "that, where":  it simply introduces a relative clause but it does not inflect, so it is distinguished from relative pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and area analysed as PRON.)
-	interrogative pronouns *ποιος* / *pios* "who", *πόσος* / *posos* "how many/much", *τι* / *ti* "what kind of" that introduce an indirect question that serves as an argument of a verb, e.g., *ρώτησα ποιο/πόσο/τι θέλεις;* / *rotisa pio/poso/ti theleis* "I asked which/how much/what do you want?"
-	*που* is assigned the tag <code>PRON</code> if it refers to a noun, e.g. *Έχουμε πολλές πληροφορίες, που*.PRON *δεν οδηγούν όμως πουθενά* 'we have much information that, however, leads to nowhere". However, if *που* does not refer to a noun then:
  -it is assigned the tag <code>SCONJ</code> when it introduces a  complement of saying or sense verbs  (criterion: in this case, it can be replaced with the word *ότι* with somewhat different implications), e.g., *σε είδα που τον κοίταζες* "I saw that you watched him",  *Δεν άκουσες που είπε: «Ευχαριστώ, ωραία μου κυρία»;* "Haven't you heard him saying "Thanks my beautiful lady"?"
  -it is assigned the tag <code>CCONJ</code> when it introduces an etiological clause  (criterion: in this case, it can be replaced with the word *γιατί* with resulting into different style probably), e.g., *Δεν σε χωνεύει που έρχεσαι τακτικά στο Μοναστήρι* "He does not like you because you are regular to the Monastery."
