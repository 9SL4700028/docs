Aspect in Modern Greek  specifies the point of view the speaker adopts, that is, whether he views the event as  a whole or whether he adopts a view from within the event. Modern Greek verbs do not provide different lemmas for their two morphologically distinct aspectual types.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The event is viewed from within: it took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

* _ψήνομαι_  "I am baked or I am being baked"
* _ψηνόμουνα_ "I was being baked"


### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect
