Aspect in Modern Greek  specifies the point of view the speaker adopts, that is, whether he views the event as  a whole or whether he adopts a view from within the event. 

In Modern Greek, aspect is not considered a lexical feature of [verbs](el-pos/VERB) and Greek verbs do not provide different lemmas for their various 
aspectual types.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect aspect

The event is viewed from within: it took / takes / will take some time span and there is no
information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* 

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect aspect

The event is viewed as a whole. It is available for past and future tenses.
