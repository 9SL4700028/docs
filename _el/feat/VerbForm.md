### <a name="Fin">`Fin`</a>: finite verb

Rule of thumb: if it has non-empty [Mood](), it is finite.
In Modern Greek this applies to indicative and imperative forms.

#### Examples

- _γράφω, γράφεις, γράφει, γράφουμε, γράφετε, γράφουν_ ;“I write, you write, he/she/it writes, we write, you write, they write”
- _γράφε, γράφετε, γράψε, γράψετε_ “carry” (imperative in different persons and numbers)
- _είμαι, είσαι, είναι, είμαστε, είσαστε, είναι_ “I am, you are, he/she/it is, we are, you are, they are”
- _έχω, έχεις, έχει, έχουμε, έχετε, έχουν_ “I have, you have, he/she/it has, we have, you have, they have”

### <a name="Inf">`Inf`</a>: infinitive

As Infinitive is marked a verb form of Modern Greek that is received from the perfective form of the verb and is used with the auxiliary έχω "have" to form certain composite tenses. It has no other usage in the language and it is not  used as the lemma form (as infinitives are traditionally used).

#### Examples

- _έχω γράψει_ “Ι have written”
- _είχα γράψει_ “Ι had written”
- _έχω γραφτεί_ "I have been written"
- _είχα γραφτεί_ "I had been written"


### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs
and adjectives. Modern Greek has two types of participles:

- The past participle (also called active participle or l-participle)
  is used to form the past tense, and the conditional mood in present or past tense.
- The passive participle
  is used to form the passive voice (in any tense or mood).

Participles inflect for [Gender]() and [Number]() but not for [Person]().

#### Examples

- _nesl, nesla, neslo, nesli, nesly_ &nbsp;“carried” (past participle in different genders and numbers)
- _nesen, nesena, neseno, neseni, neseny_ &nbsp;“carried” (passive participle in different genders and numbers)
- _byl, byla, bylo, byli, byly_ &nbsp;“was/been” (past participle in different genders and numbers)

### <a name="Conv">`Conv`</a>: converb, transgressive

The converb, also called transgressive, adverbial participle or gerund, is a non-finite
verb form that shares properties of verbs and adverbs.

Imperfective verbs form present converb, meaning “while doing”.

Perfective verbs form past converb, meaning “having done”.

#### Examples

- _nesa, nesouc, nesouce_ &nbsp;“carrying” (present transgressive in different genders and numbers)
- _přines, přinesši, přinesše_ &nbsp;“having brought” (past transgressive in different genders and numbers)
- _jsa, jsouc, jsouce_ &nbsp;“being” (present transgressive in different genders and numbers)
- _byv, byvši, byvše_ &nbsp;“having been” (past transgressive in different genders and numbers)
- _zírali na mne, pevně <b>svírajíce</b> své zbraně&nbsp;_ “they
  stared at me <b>while gripping</b> their guns firmly”
- _<b>udělavši</b> večeři, zavolala rodinu ke stolu&nbsp;_ “<b>having
  prepared</b> the dinner, she called her family to the table”
