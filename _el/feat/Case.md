Case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](el-pos/NOUN), [proper nouns](el-pos/PROPN), [adjectives](el-pos/ADJ), [determiners](el-pos/DET), [pronouns](el-pos/PRON),  [numerals ](el-pos/NUM) and [verbs](el-pos/VERB).


Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example, the nominative case is the typical case of nominal subjects and contrasts with the accusative case which typically marks objects. However, the accusative case is used to mark nouns in adverbial usages as well.

Modern Greek morphology distinguishes four cases:
`Nom`, `Gen`,  `Acc`, `Voc`. Dative was a case used in classical Greek; in Modern Greek it is occurs in fixed expressions inherited from classical Creek, e.g. γη _πυρί_ μιχθήτω 'let earth be mixed with fire". We have decided not to use the label 'Dat' in fixed expressions. 

#### Examples

* singular nominative _matka&nbsp;_ “mother”, genitive _matky&nbsp;,_ dative _matce,&nbsp;_
  accusative _matku,&nbsp;_ vocative _matko,&nbsp;_ locative _matce,&nbsp;_ instrumental _matkou_
* plural nominative _matky,&nbsp;_ genitive _matek,&nbsp;_ dative _matkám,&nbsp;_
  accusative _matky,&nbsp;_ vocative _matky,&nbsp;_ locative _matkách,&nbsp;_ instrumental _matkami_

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here. Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma).
This is the word form used for subjects of clauses.

#### Examples

* _<b>Jan</b> spí._ “<b>Jan</b> sleeps.”
* _<b>Jan</b> miluje Marii. “<b>Jan</b> loves Marie.”

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Prototypical meaning of genitive is that the noun phrase somehow
belongs to its governor; it would often be translated by the English
preposition _of._

Note that despite considerable semantic overlap, the genitive case is
not the same as the feature of possessivity ([Poss]()). Possessivity
is a lexical feature, i.e. it applies to lemma and its whole
paradigm. Genitive is a feature of just a subset of word forms of the
lemma. Semantics of possessivity is much more clearly defined while
the genitive (as many other cases) may be required in situations that
have nothing to do with possessing. For example, _bez
prezidentovy dcery&nbsp;_ “without the president's daughter” is a
prepositional phrase containing the preposition _bez&nbsp;_ “without”, the
possessive adjective _prezidentovy&nbsp;_ “president's” and the noun _dcery&nbsp;_
“daughter”. The possessive adjective is derived from the noun
_prezident&nbsp;_ but it is really an adjective (with separate lemma and
paradigm), not just a form of the noun. In addition, both the
adjective and the noun are in their genitive forms (the nominative
would be _prezidentova dcera_).  There is nothing possessive about
this particular occurrence of the genitive. It is there because the
preposition _bez&nbsp;_ always requires its argument to be in genitive.

#### Examples

* _Praha je hlavní město <b>České republiky</b>.&nbsp;_ “Prague is the
  capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>.”



### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case.
This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Jan miluje <b>Marii</b>. “Jan loves <b>Marie</b>.”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address
someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical
restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.

#### Examples

* _Co myslíš, <b>Filipe</b>?&nbsp;_ “What do you think,
  <b>Filip</b>?”
