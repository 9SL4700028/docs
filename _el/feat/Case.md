Case is an inflectional feature of [nouns](el-pos/NOUN), [proper nouns](el-pos/PROPN), [adjectives](el-pos/ADJ), [determiners](el-pos/DET), [pronouns](el-pos/PRON),  [numerals ](el-pos/NUM) and [verbs](el-pos/VERB).


Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence.
For example,  typically nominative  is the case of nominal subjects and contrasts with the accusative case that typically marks objects. However, the accusative case is used to mark nouns in adverbial usages as well.

Modern Greek morphology distinguishes four cases:
`Nom`, `Gen`,  `Acc`, `Voc`. Dative was a case used in classical Greek; in Modern Greek it is occurs in fixed expressions inherited from classical Creek, e.g. γη _πυρί_ μιχθήτω 'let earth be mixed with fire". We have decided not to use the label 'Dat' in fixed expressions. 

#### Examples

* singular nominative _μητέρα_ “mother”, genitive _μητέρας_ 
  accusative _μητ΄έρα_ vocative _μητέρα_ 
* plural nominative μητέρες_ genitive _μητέρων_ 
 accusative _μητ΄έρες_ vocative _μητέρες_ 

The descriptions of the individual case values below include semantic
hints about the prototypical meaning of the case. Bear in mind that
quite often a case will be used for a meaning that is totally
unrelated to the meaning mentioned here. Valency of verbs,
adpositions and other words will determine that the noun phrase must
be in a particular grammatical case to fill a particular valency slot
(semantic role).

### <a name="Nom">`Nom`</a>: nominative

The base form of the noun, also used as citation form (lemma).
This is the word form used for subjects of clauses.

#### Examples

* _Η Χαρά κοιμάται._ “_Chara_ sleeps.”
* _Η δασκάλα_ αγαπά τον Μάρκο._ “_The teacher_ loves Markos.”

### <a name="Gen">`Gen`</a>: genitive

Genitives prototypically mark possessors. In Modern Greek it is the case of the indirect object (typically with verbs of giving and saying).



#### Examples

* _Praha je hlavní město <b>České republiky</b>.&nbsp;_ “Prague is the
  capital <b>of the Czech Republic</b>.”



### <a name="Acc">`Acc`</a>: accusative

Perhaps the second most widely spread morphological case.
This is the word form most frequently used for direct objects of verbs.

#### Examples

* _Jan miluje <b>Marii</b>. “Jan loves <b>Marie</b>.”

### <a name="Voc">`Voc`</a>: vocative

The vocative case is a special form of noun used to address
someone. Thus it predominantly appears with animate nouns (see the
feature of [Animacy]()). Nevertheless this is not a grammatical
restriction and inanimate things can be addressed as well.

#### Examples

* _Co myslíš, <b>Filipe</b>?&nbsp;_ “What do you think,
  <b>Filip</b>?”
