The root of the utterance, that word, which depends on no other word. Usually this is the predicate, a verb if available, otherwise the nominal predicate of a nominal sentence. In fragments, such as a plain nominal phrase or a single interjection, the local root (i.e. the noun head, or the interjection) is the root.
