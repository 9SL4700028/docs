For all cases not covered by these guidelines, the label dep may be used to denote the unusual dependency. Ideally, these cases should be re-examined and integrated into the guidelines at a later date.

Another specific use of `dep` in the Coptic Treebank is as the function of tokens representing lacunae (e.g. `[...]`) or tokens representing incomplete words which cannot be reconstructed from context. These are all attached to the root/local root of their clause.
