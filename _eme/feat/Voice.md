`Voice` indicates the relationship between the action and its participants.

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: Causative

In Tekó, the causative voice is marked with morphemes _`-bo`_/_`-okar`_/_`-ero`_. 

The direct causation morpheme _`-bo`_ (_`-mo`_, _`-mõ`_) is inserted  between the person index and the verb root and expresses that someone makes someone else perform the action described with an intransitive verb.

The morpheme _`-okar`_ (_`-kar`_ after /o/ and /u/) is inserted between the person index and the verb and indicates that someone causes someone else to perform the action on another person . It is less frequent than _`bo-`_ and has not been lexicalized.

#### Examples

* _wane idʒe a<b>mo</b>zaug&nbsp;_ “I wash it well.”
* _seg o<b>bo</b>apɨg&nbsp;_ “Poof, he sits her down.”
* _okaʔar<b>okar</b>&nbsp;_ “We had it destroyed (the restaurant).”
* _idʒeate lekol aiɲuŋ<b>okar</b>&nbsp;_ “It was I who made to establish the school.”

### <a name="SCau">`SCau`</a>: 

In Tekó, the sociative causative voice is marked with morphemes _`-bo`_/_`-okar`_/_`-ero`_.

## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
