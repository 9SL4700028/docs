## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

*

---
**Instruction**: Most other languages use white spaces to separate words. However, Vietnamese puts spaces between syllables, not between words. A word can have one, two or more syllables. Therefore, the separation of words in Vietnamese is quite complicated because there are many ways to divide syllables into words, causing ambiguity.
Some examples of words in Vietnamese: đi (go), chơi (play), ăn (eat), danh sách (list), điện thoại (phone), ban nhạc (band), ....
