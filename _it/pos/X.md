### Definition

The tag `X` is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned
a real part-of-speech category.

Note that the universal guidelines recommend the usage of `X` for cases of code-switching where it is not possible (or meaningful) to analyze the intervening language grammatically (and where the dependency relation _foreign_ is
typically used in the syntactic analysis).

This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words where it is assigned a normal
part-of-speech.
